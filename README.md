# Sales Report Dashboard

## Description

This project is an interactive Excel dashboard that displays sales data for a fictional company. The dashboard allows users to filter and analyze the data by various criteria, such as month, state, product, and revenue. The dashboard also includes a map that shows the sales distribution by state, and a chart that shows the top 5 products by revenue.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to create a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard using Excel features such as pivot tables, slicers, charts, and formulas. The project also shows how to use Power Query and Power Map to import and visualize external data sources.

## Features

- A main dashboard sheet that displays key metrics and charts based on the selected filters
- A data sheet that contains the raw sales data for 12 months
- A map sheet that shows the sales by state using Power Map
- A top 5 sheet that shows the top 5 products by revenue using a pivot chart
- A slicer sheet that contains the slicers for filtering the data by month, state, product category, and product name
